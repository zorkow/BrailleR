\title{Create a standard time series plot with a few extra elements added to the output object}
\description{This function is a wrapper to the standard \code{plott()} function in the \pkg{graphics} package. It is tailored to generating a time series plot, and adds detail to the stored object so that a better text description can be formulated using the \code{VI()} method in the \pkg{BrailleR} package.}
\usage{
TimeSeriesPlot(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{a numeric variable.}
  \item{\dots}{
additional arguments passed on to the plotting function.}
}
\details{
This wrapper will draw the base graphics plot for a time series.}
\value{
An object of class tsplot, with the addition of any calls to the main title or axis labels being explicitly stored even if a zero length character string.}
