\description{
The first argument to this function must be a call to create a graph, such as a histogram. Instead of opening a new graphics device, the graph will be created in a pdf file, with all text being presented using  a braille font. The function is somewhat experimental as the best braille font is not yet confirmed, and a number of examples need to be tested on a variety of embossers before full confidence in the function is given.
}
\details{
The user's chosen braille font must be installed. This might include the default font shipped as part of the package.
